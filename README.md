# Gamerator // A React Video Game Rating Website
![Website in Action](Gamerator.gif)

This website lets users log in, and vote only once for their favorite game. Uses React, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

## Latest Games
Using the Graw.io API, we are able to seed the database of the latest games, and display them on our website for users.

### Server -- Node JS / Express
 There is another repo required for the server, [Gamerator Server](https://github.com/mattlol85/Gamerator_Server).
 The backend of this application uses Sequelize to utilize our database which is running Postgres.

### Google Login
 Google Login is required to gain access to the website. This is to ensure no duplicate votes.
